# Updated Voice & Sensitivity System - Test Instructions

## ✅ Changes Completed

### 1. Gain Control Removed
- ❌ Removed microphone gain/amplification slider
- ❌ Removed all `mic_gain` related variables and methods
- ✅ Simplified interface with single sensitivity control

### 2. Enhanced Sensitivity Range
- ✅ Sensitivity range now: **1 (ultra-sensitive) to 3000 (less sensitive)**
- ✅ Threshold slider starts from 1 instead of 50
- ✅ Auto-calibrate now uses minimum threshold of 1
- ✅ Direct threshold control - no complex gain calculations

### 3. Voice Selection Improvements
- ✅ Main chat now reads selected voice from settings
- ✅ Only loads the specific voice selected (e.g., just "Ava")
- ✅ No unnecessary loading of all 13 voices
- ✅ Microphone disabled during TTS to prevent feedback

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test 1: Voice Selection in Main Chat
```bash
cd c:\Users\KarlBotha\AI_PROJECTS\VPA
python gui_screen_tester.py main
```
1. Go to Settings → Voice & Audio
2. Select a specific voice (e.g., "Ava")
3. Save settings
4. Return to main chat
5. Send a message and verify the correct voice responds

### Test 2: Ultra-Sensitive Microphone
```bash
cd c:\Users\KarlBotha\AI_PROJECTS\VPA
python gui_screen_tester.py settings
```
1. Go to Voice & Audio tab
2. Set sensitivity slider to **1** (leftmost position)
3. Click "Record Voice" and speak very quietly
4. Verify it captures even whispered speech
5. Test auto-calibrate - should start from 1 minimum

### Test 3: No Feedback Loop
1. In main chat, ask the AI a question
2. Verify the microphone is automatically disabled while the AI speaks
3. Verify microphone re-enables after AI finishes speaking
4. Confirm AI doesn't hear and respond to its own voice

## 📊 Sensitivity Guide

| Threshold | Sensitivity Level | Use Case |
|-----------|------------------|----------|
| 1-10      | ULTRA Sensitive  | Whisper detection |
| 11-100    | Very High        | Quiet speaking |
| 101-500   | High             | Normal speaking |
| 501-1000  | Medium           | Louder environments |
| 1001-3000 | Lower            | Noisy environments |

## 🔧 Settings File Location
Voice settings saved to: `C:\Users\KarlBotha\.vpa_settings.json`

Current test setting:
```json
{
  "current_voice": "Ava",
  "mic_threshold": 1,
  "voice_enabled": true,
  "microphone_enabled": true
}
```

## ✅ Expected Results

1. **Main Chat Voice**: Should use only "Ava" voice as selected
2. **Microphone Sensitivity**: Threshold of 1 should detect very quiet speech
3. **No Feedback**: AI won't hear itself and create response loops
4. **Performance**: Faster loading since only one voice loads instead of 13
5. **Simplified UI**: Clean interface without confusing gain controls

## 🚀 Ready to Test!

The system is now optimized for:
- ✅ Maximum sensitivity (threshold=1)
- ✅ Correct voice selection in main chat
- ✅ No feedback loops
- ✅ Simplified, user-friendly controls
