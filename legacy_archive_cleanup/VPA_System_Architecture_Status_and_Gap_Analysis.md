# VPA System: Architecture, Policies, and Design Decisions – Status & Gap Analysis

**Report Date:** July 15, 2025  
**Author:** AI Development Assistant  
**Project Status:** Active Development – Priority 2 Implementation Phase  

---

## 0. Base App (LLM Conversation/Core)
_Status: **TBD** (Planning Defined; Implementation Pending)_

**Conversational Memory**
- Persistent memory across sessions (not just session-based).
- Users may view, edit, or delete conversation history.
- History is single-user only; no shared or global histories.

**User Logic and Personalization**
- LLM stores comprehensive user profile data (name, preferences, roles, etc.) except high-risk data (e.g., banking) unless specifically approved.
- System aims to record as much personal info as needed for daily task/life assistance within logical and privacy boundaries.
- Users can update, reset, or export their profile and logic.

**Learning and Feedback**
- LLM will not learn from user corrections/feedback in the base app; learning is enabled only after RAG/plugins are added.

**History and Context Window**
- Number of previous messages/interactions used as context is user-specified (user-configurable context window).
- Users can "pin" important messages to keep them in active context longer.
- Ability to start a new/fresh conversation at any time.

**Data Privacy and Export**
- Users can export or delete their entire chat history at will.
- Encryption and privacy requirements are enforced for all user logic/history storage (data-at-rest and in-transit).

**UI/UX**
- Users see a timeline/history of all their conversations.
- Search and filter capabilities for past conversations.
- Single-user interface (no team/multi-user features in core base app).

**Other Core Features**
- Onboarding flow, help/support system, and feedback submission are included.
- Authentication is required for access (recommend modern OAuth2 or passwordless sign-in).
- Notifications framework needed for system messages, reminders, etc. (recommend local or OS notifications, with optional email/mobile push in future).

---

**Open items for implementation/advice:**
- Select authentication method: OAuth2, passwordless email, or SSO for best UX/security.
- Notifications: Start with local/app notifications; optionally plan for integration with mobile/email.
- Persistent memory storage choice: Recommend encrypted SQLite, local database, or secure cloud (with user control over location).

---

## 1. Core Schema for Plugins/Add-ons
_Status: **COMPLETE**_  
**Implementation Details:**  
- Standardized plugin interface (class/function)
- Event bus integration
- Automatic discovery
- Lifecycle management with error handling
- 100% test coverage

---

## 2. Plugin Registration & Source Approval
_Status: **COMPLETE** (Basic) / **TBD** (Enhanced UI)_  
**Current Implementation:**  
- Automatic discovery and dynamic import
- Registration and event-based notification
- Error handling and logging

**Missing Features (TBD):**
- Preview UI
- Manual approval workflow
- Plugin signature/security scans
- Marketplace/catalog

---

## 3. Data Deletion Behavior
_Status: **IN PROGRESS** (Reference Implementation Available)_  
**Reference:**  
- Multi-stage confirmation
- Category-specific deletion
- GDPR/CCPA compliance

**Current VPA Gap:**  
- No user data persistence yet  
- Session management not in core  
- Config deletion only

**Next Steps:**  
- Implement persistent storage and integrate deletion

---

## 4. Audit Logging and User Visibility
_Status: **COMPLETE** (Structured Logging) / **IN PROGRESS** (User Access)_  
**Implemented:**  
- Structured JSON logging
- Performance and security event logging
- Correlation IDs

**Missing:**  
- User log viewer
- Log filtering/search
- Multi-user control
- Log retention/rotation

---

## 5. User Feedback on Memory
_Status: **TBD** (Core VPA) / **COMPLETE** (Reference)_  
**Reference:**  
- Feedback types, response tracking, user comments, quality system

**Current VPA Gap:**  
- No LLM integration, feedback, or memory system yet

**Future Requirements:**  
- Session management, feedback interfaces, memory/learning, LLM plugin

---

## 6. Data Retention & Expiry
_Status: **TBD** (Core VPA) / **Reference Available**_  
**Reference:**  
- Local data retention, analytics/session retention, configurable periods

**Current VPA:**  
- No persistent storage/retention enforcement  
- Config files persist indefinitely  
- Logs grow without rotation

**Required:**  
- Database, retention policies, cleanup/archival, pin/notification, per-category settings

---

## 7. Data Export & Portability
_Status: **TBD** (Core VPA) / **COMPLETE** (Reference)_  
**Reference:**  
- JSON export, privacy compliance, backup integration

**Current VPA:**  
- No persistent user data to export  
- Config export limited  
- No backup/migration tools

**Next:**  
- Persistent data, export, backup/restore, cross-platform support

---

## 8. General System Philosophies
_Status: **COMPLETE** (Architecture) / **IN PROGRESS** (Implementation)_  
**Principles:**  
- Modularity, testability, operational resilience, fault tolerance, security by design, privacy by design, user control, extensibility, reliability, transparency

**Approaches:**  
- Hybrid architecture, progressive enhancement, developer experience, operational excellence

---

### 9.1 Health Monitoring System – **COMPLETE**
### 9.2 Plugin Error Boundaries – **COMPLETE** ✅
### 9.3 Config Backup/Restore – **PENDING**
### 9.4 Security Implementation – **IN PROGRESS**

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize Must-Have Features:**  
   - Implement persistent memory, user history controls, encryption, profile management, authentication, and conversation controls first.

2. **Design & Build UX:**  
   - History timeline, editing, search/filter, onboarding/help, notifications.

3. **Review Security:**  
   - Ensure all user data is encrypted and privacy policies are enforced.

4. **Iterate:**  
   - Integrate feedback, refine UX, and stage for RAG/plugin expansion.
