## Notes & Considerations

**Crash Recovery Context**: This checklist was generated after resuming from a PowerShell script crash during knowledge reconnaissance. All signal gathering was completed manually to ensure comprehensive coverage.

**Dependency Priority**: Focus on `requirements.reconstructed.txt` as the authoritative dependency list until full requirements.txt is validated and confirmed working.

**Testing Strategy**: Prioritize fixing import errors before comprehensive test execution to ensure accurate coverage metrics and functionality validation.

**Performance Monitoring**: Implement continuous performance tracking early to prevent regression during feature development.
