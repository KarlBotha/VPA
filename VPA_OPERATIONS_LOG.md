## üéØ USER INTERACTION GUIDELINES

### Voice Selection
```python
# Change voice via VPA system
vpa_voice.set_voice("Guy")        # Male voice
vpa_voice.set_voice("Emma")       # Female voice  
vpa_voice.set_voice("Aria")       # Return to default
```

### Testing Voices
```python
# Test specific voice
vpa_voice.test_voice("Christopher")

# Test current voice
vpa_voice.test_voice()

# Get available voices
voices = vpa_voice.get_available_voices()
```

### System Status
```python
# Get system health
status = vpa_voice.get_system_status()

# Get current voice info
current = vpa_voice.get_current_voice()
```
