## 🎯 Priority 2 Actions Progress

### 1. Structured Logging System ✅ COMPLETED
- **Implementation:** JSON-structured logs with correlation IDs, metadata, and searchable fields
- **Coverage:** 36% (115/115 statements, 28/31 tests passing)
- **Files:** `src/vpa/core/logging.py`, `tests/core/test_logging.py`
- **Features:**
  - ✅ JSON-formatted log output with correlation tracking
  - ✅ Performance logging with duration metrics
  - ✅ Security event logging with detailed context
  - ✅ User action audit trails
  - ✅ Exception handling with stack traces
  - ✅ Configurable log levels and output destinations

### 2. Health Monitoring & Endpoints ✅ COMPLETED
- **Implementation:** Comprehensive health check system with system metrics monitoring
- **Coverage:** 74% (249/249 statements, 31/31 tests passing)
- **Files:** `src/vpa/core/health.py`, `tests/core/test_health.py`
- **Features:**
  - ✅ System resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
  - ✅ Component health tracking with status aggregation
  - ✅ JSON health endpoints for integration
  - ✅ Customizable health check registration
  - ✅ Performance metrics collection
  - ✅ Health status enumeration (healthy/degraded/unhealthy/unknown)

### 3. Plugin Error Boundaries ⏳ IN PROGRESS
- **Current Gap:** Plugin failures can crash entire application
- **Implementation:** Error isolation, graceful degradation, plugin watchdog
- **Risk Reduction:** System resilience, fault tolerance

### 4. Configuration Backup & Restore ⏳ PENDING
- **Current Gap:** No automated config backup or recovery
- **Implementation:** Automated backup system, restore capabilities, version management
- **Risk Reduction:** Data loss prevention, configuration recovery
